4.  make some pretty ui that isn't so bootstrappy
5.  allow more granular config, such as loading voice collections and some ui options
6.  recording - if you like a loop, keep it!
7.  ~~3D print arduino housing~~
8.  ~~implement curly microphone cord to link shoes~~
9. ~~create better way to secure arduino to body~~
10. solder sensors to a breakout shield
