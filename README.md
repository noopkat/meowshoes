### TODO:
1.  ~~reorganise code and objects~~
2.  ~~establish that the latest refactor actually works~~
3.  convert wires to low energy bluetooth solution
4.  make some pretty ui that isn't so bootstrappy
5.  allow more granular config, such as loading voice collections and some ui options
6.  recording - if you like a loop, keep it!
7.  learn how to use the darn shoes and make actual music ^__^
