# Meow Shoes

Musical shoes project, created at the Vegas Hack Fashion Tech Hackathon. 

Demo video from the hackathon is [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1g3M6PILqqQ "Meow Shoes Demo on Youtube").

### Stuff I used, written by talented people:
+ Web Audio API (Chrome) - [link](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001552/ch01.html "O'Reilly Guide to Audio API")
+ Abbey Load helper - [link](http://stuartmemo.com/abbey-load/ "Abbey Load website")
+ Node.js - [link](http://nodejs.org "Node JS website")

### Node nodules used:
+ Bopper - [link](https://npmjs.org/package/bopper)
+ Browserify - [link](https://npmjs.org/package/browserify)
+ Socket.io - [link](https://npmjs.org/package/socket.io)
+ Serialport - [link](https://npmjs.org/package/serialport)

Thank you, all of the authors of the above libs/modules are way better programmers than me.

### TODO:
1.  ~~reorganise code and objects~~
2.  implement Audia for the sound playing, but keep abbey load's sound object format for dynamic loading
3.  ~~establish that the latest refactor actually works~~
4.  make some pretty ui that isn't so bootstrappy
5.  allow more granular config, such as loading voice collections and some ui options
6.  recording - if you like a loop, keep it!
7.  learn how to use the darn shoes and make actual music ^__^
